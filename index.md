Hey, I’m Kashish Srivastava-currently Masters's Student at IIT Delhi’s School of AI (MTech MINDS), with a soft spot for reinforcement learning and a hard drive full of ideas. I graduated from NIT Hamirpur (CSE, 2022), where I learned that debugging code and tuning guitars both require serious patience and the occasional existential crisis.

Outside the lab, you’ll find me behind a camera, under a barbell, or lost in a film that probably has a Rotten Tomatoes score I’ll defend to the grave.
